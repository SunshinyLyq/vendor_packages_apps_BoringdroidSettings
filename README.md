# BoringdroidSettings

The settings app for Boringdroid.

## SettingsLib

The `SettingsLib` is framework library to provide basic function for settings, and we can  build it
with `m SettingsLib` from current branch boringdroid. When we update `AOSP` version, we should update
`SettingsLib` with the newest `AOSP` source code.
